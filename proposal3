               the strength and nature of the relationship between education,

               with apprenticeship. The discussion draws on two contrasting

               programs of publicly funded vocational learning (including
               apprenticeships) and the qualifications associated with them need

               way of improving organizational performance, the debate about the
               learning organization has grown. Counterbalancing the often
               over-optimistic assumptions made about the future of work and
               learning, this book argues that without a contextualized analysis
               of the field, our understanding of the learning environment is
               limited. It reconsiders the true role and nature of workplace
               learning in context. Grounded in original research, the book
               features case studies which illuminate how the workplace
               environment can provide both barriers to and opportunities for
               learning. It explores learning in different organizational
               contexts and different countries, sectors, types of public and
               private sector organization, and by different occupational
               groups. This multi-disciplinary approach provides a coherent
               perspective of the institutional, organizational and pedagogical
               contexts of workplace learning, and as a result, policy-makers,
               trainers, trade unionists and educators alike will welcome this

               understand economic and political polarization in the age of
               automation From the Industrial Revolution to the age of
               artificial intelligence, The Technology Trap takes a sweeping
               look at the history of technological progress and how it has
               radically shifted the distribution of economic and political
               power among society's members. As Carl Benedikt Frey shows, the
               Industrial Revolution created unprecedented wealth and prosperity
               over the long run, but the immediate consequences of
               mechanization were devastating for large swaths of the
               population. Middle-income jobs withered, wages stagnated, the
               labor share of income fell, profits surged, and economic
               inequality skyrocketed. These trends, Frey documents, broadly
               mirror those in our current age of automation, which began with
               the Computer Revolution. Just as the Industrial Revolution
               eventually brought about extraordinary benefits for society,
               artificial intelligence systems have the potential to do the
               same. But Frey argues that this depends on how the short term is
               managed. In the nineteenth century, workers violently expressed
               their concerns over machines taking their jobs. The Luddite
               uprisings joined a long wave of machinery riots that swept across
               Europe and China. Today's despairing middle class has not
               resorted to physical force, but their frustration has led to
               rising populism and the increasing fragmentation of society. As
               middle-class jobs continue to come under pressure, there's no
               assurance that positive attitudes to technology will persist. The
               Industrial Revolution was a defining moment in history, but few
               grasped its enormous consequences at the time. The Technology
               Trap demonstrates that in the midst of another technological
               revolution, the lessons of the past can help us to more
               effectively face the present.},

               as its key purposes, objects, formation and practices. In short,
               it seeks to outline and elaborate the nature of the project of
               vocational education. It addresses a significant gap in the
               available literature by providing a single text that elaborates
               the scope and diversity of the sector, its key objectives (i.e.
               vocations and occupations), its formation and development as an
               education sector, and the scope of its purposes and
               considerations in the curriculum. The volume achieves these
               objectives by discussing and defining the concept of vocational
               education as being that form of education that seeks to advise
               individuals about, prepare them for, and further develop their
               capacities to perform the kinds of occupations that societies
               require and individuals need to participate in—and through which
               they often come to define themselves. In particular, it discusses
               the distinctions between occupations as a largely social fact and
               vocations as being a socially shaped outcome assented to by
               individuals. As people identify closely with the kinds of
               occupations they engage in, the standing of, and the
               effectiveness of vocational education is central to individuals’
               well-being, competence and progress. Ultimately, this book argues
               that the provision of vocational education needs to realise
               important personal and social goals.},

  abstract     = {New union members in the United States are typically gained
                  through workplace elections. We find that the annual number of
                  union elections fell by 50 per cent in the early 1980s. A
                  formal model indicates that declining union election activity
                  may be due to an unfavourable political climate which raises
                  the costs of unionization, even though the union win–rate
                  remains unaffected. We relate the timing of declining election
                  activity to the air–traffic controllers’ strike of 1981, and
                  the appointment of the Reagan Labor Board in 1983. Empirical
                  analysis shows that the fall in election activity preceded
                  these developments.},

                 question: 'What learning happens in the workplace, and how is

                 research findings - both quantitative and qualitative - and
                 identifies ten key messages: (1) The starting points are to
                 recognise that: (a) paradigms of learning differ; and (b)
                 workplaces are contested spaces in which what counts as
                 'learning'; (2) Measures of 'learning as acquisition' include
                 the incidence of workplace training; (3) Real levels of
                 training expenditure by employers have also moved downwards;
                 (4) Despite the emphasis placed on training course attendance
                 and the acquisition of qualifications, both are relatively
                 low-rated by employees in terms of their helpfulness in
                 improving work performance; (5) At a time when formal workplace
                 training has been declining, the evidence suggests that the
                 importance of learning on-the-job is rising; (6) All sources of
                 workplace learning from whatever paradigm are skewed towards
                 those at the top of the occupational hierarchy; (7) Much of the
                 qualitative evidence shows that learning occurs naturally in
                 all workplaces as part of everyday activity in line with the
                 learning as participation approach; (8) Workplace learning
                 takes many forms stretching across a 'formal-informal'
                 continuum; (9) International research evidence suggests that
                 the key inter-related determinants in the variability of
                 workplace learning environments are context and individual
                 behaviour; and (10) External recognition and accreditation of
                 workplace learning is problematic due to its largely collective
                 and dynamic nature.},

                  learning (WIL) has expanded considerably. While early research
                  predominantly utilized quantitative study designs, recently a
                  more diverse set of methodologies is being used to address
                  questions and issues arising from a range of WIL models. This
                  Special Issue is intended to present different methodologies
                  available to WIL researchers. The papers include case studies
                  of how these methodologies, and methods within, are being used
                  for WIL research, along with discussion of the strengths and
                  limitations of using the research approach. Examples of case
                  study methodology, multiple case studies, mixed methods,
                  program evaluation research, hermeneutic phenomenology,
                  grounded theory, reflective practice as research, and

                  particular contexts making it highly suited to flexible,
                  multiple perspective methodologies, such as case study.
                  However, case study methodology is often criticized for being
                  too specific, not generalizable and limited in what it can
                  contribute to theory. In addition, there is often confusion
                  between the meaning and application of the terms method and
                  methodology. This paper presents an argument to help guide and
                  support researchers who are considering a case study approach
                  to their WIL research. Two vignettes demonstrate how
                  researchers overcame some of the alleged limitations of case
                  study as a methodology and utilized the benefits to advance
                  the theory and practice of WIL. Case study provides a sound
                  methodology that can reflect the variability of research
                  contexts and enables a flexible approach to address a wide

  abstract     = {[John Dewey and L. S. Vygotsky share similar ideas concerning
                  the relationship of activity and learning/development,
                  especially the roles everyday activities and social
                  environment play in the educational process. However, the two
                  theorists are far apart in their conception of the
                  relationship between process and goals in education. Dewey
                  concentrates on means in education, believing that it is the
                  ability of the individual to question through experience that
                  is most important for the human community. Vygotsky, while
                  recognizing the importance of (especially cultural) process in
                  education, sees social and cultural goals as being integrated
                  into social pedagogy. This paper compares Dewey and Vygotsky
                  on three key points that relate directly to educational
                  processes and goals. First, the two theorists are compared on
                  the role of social history and the tools it produces. Dewey
                  sees social history as creating a set of malleable tools that
                  are of use in present circumstances. Vygotsky believes that
                  tools developed through history have a far more lasting impact
                  on the social community. Second, the two theorists are
                  compared in their conceptualizations of experience/culture.
                  Dewey sees experience as helping to form thinking, whereas
                  Vygotsky, in his cultural historical theory, posits culture as
                  the raw material of thinking. Third, the two theorists are
                  compared on their perspectives on human inquiry. Dewey sees
                  the child as a free agent who achieves goals through her own
                  interest in the activity. Vygotsky suggests there should be
                  greater control by a mentor who creates activity that will
                  lead the child towards mastery. These differences are then
                  explored in terms of how they might impact actual classroom
                  strategies and curriculum.]},

               of skill. One such position is the social construction of skill.
               When it was first proposed it was driven by feminist concerns
               about the sex-typing of jobs and women’s exclusion from jobs
               labelled as skilled. This chapter offers a new social
               construction of skill. It appreciates that the old social
               construction of skill has not disappeared but points out that the
               context within which this construction occurred has changed, with
               weaker labour unions and the decline in the manufacturing
               industries. With more service jobs and stronger employers, the
               chapter argues that in the wealthier countries there have been
               two shifts: a shift in how skill has been defined and a shift in
               who has the power to define it. Focusing on gender, race and
               class, the chapters explains how the social construction of skill
               has been restructured in three ways. First, more importance is
               attached to ascription of skill. Second, who is and isn’t deemed
               to be skilled has changed. Third, the lines between achieved and
               ascribed skill are increasingly blurred. The chapter finishes by
               suggesting ways in which the discrimination arising from this new
               social construction of skill might be addressed.},

               learning that are often dichotomized: formal and informal, theory
               and practice. Indeed one of the central challenges facing all
               those involved in developing understandings of workplace learning
               is that of conceptualizing how these aspects of learning actually
               come together within the experience of the learners. This chapter
               outlines key aspects of our research into the accountancy
               profession which aims, amongst other things, to assist in the
               re-engineering of the learning experience within accountancy,
               into something more ‘integrative’. We believe a focus on context,
               power and perspective, within an understanding of the
               ‘disciplinary ways of being’ at the heart of modern learning, is
               fundamental to understandings of learning and also to the process
               of change management within education and training. We offer an
               analysis of our template for change within education and training
               in the accountancy profession framed within a discussion of those

                  studies alone are not enough. In this paper, we argue for an
                  ecological or scaled approach that travels through macro, meso
                  and micro levels to build nested case-studies to allow for
                  more comprehensive analysis of the external and internal
                  factors that shape policy-making and education systems. Such
                  an approach allows for deeper understanding of the

                  between workplace learning, the organisation of work, level of

                  broader economic, regulatory, and social context within which
                  organisations have to operate. This article argues that we
                  have to identify and take serious account of the contextual
                  factors (external and internal) that affect all organisations,
                  as these are central to developing our understanding of the
                  nature of pedagogical practice within any workplace setting.
                  By closely examining the nature and impact of these contextual
                  factors, we can gain greater insight into the phenomenon of
                  why organisations adopt different practices and why they
                  create such different learning environments. The article draws
                  on emerging findings from an ESRC?funded multisector study in

                  capital, knowledge-creating organizations, knowledge work, and
                  the like rests on a single, traditional understanding of the
                  nature of knowledge. We call this understanding the
                  ?epistemology of possession,? since it treats knowledge as
                  something people possess. Yet, this epistemology cannot
                  account for the knowing found in individual and group
                  practice. Knowing as action calls for an ?epistemology of
                  practice.? Moreover, the epistemology of possession tends to
                  privilege explicit over tacit knowledge, and knowledge
                  possessed by individuals over that possessed by groups.
                  Current work on organizations is limited by this privileging
                  and by the scant attention given to knowing in its own right.
                  Organizations are better understood if explicit, tacit,
                  individual and group knowledge are treated as four distinct
                  and coequal forms of knowledge (each doing work the others
                  cannot), and if knowledge and knowing are seen as mutually
                  enabling (not competing). We hold that knowledge is a tool of
                  knowing, that knowing is an aspect of our interaction with the
                  social and physical world, and that the interplay of knowledge
                  and knowing can generate new knowledge and new ways of
                  knowing. We believe this generative dance between knowledge
                  and knowing is a powerful source of organizational innovation.
                  Harnessing this innovation calls for organizational and
                  technological infrastructures that support the interplay of
                  knowledge and knowing. Ultimately, these concepts make
                  possible a more robust framing of such
                  epistemologically-centered concerns as core competencies, the
                  management of intellectual capital, etc. We explore these
                  views through three brief case studies drawn from recent
                  research.},

                  a simplistic four stage cycle which is attributed to Kolb
                  (1984). However, it will be demonstrated in this article that
                  this is a misinterpretation of Kolb's theory which results in
                  a limited view of 'experience' within experiential learning.
                  It is argued that not only a deeper understanding of Kolb's
                  original theory is required, but a return must be made to John
                  Dewey, perhaps the architect of experiential learning, to
                  fully comprehend its importance. In so doing, a fuller
                  appreciation of young people's experience is acquired, as well

  abstract  = {The great Russian psychologist L. S. Vygotsky has long been
               recognized as a pioneer in developmental psychology. But somewhat
               ironically, his theory of development has never been well
               understood in the West. Mind in Society should correct much of
               this misunderstanding. Carefully edited by a group of outstanding
               Vygotsky scholars, the book presents a unique selection of
               Vygotsky’s important essays, most of which have previously been
               unavailable in English.The Vygotsky who emerges from these pages
               can no longer be glibly included among the neobehaviorists. In
               these essays he outlines a dialectical-materialist theory of
               cognitive development that anticipates much recent work in
               American social science. The mind, Vygotsky argues, cannot be
               understood in isolation from the surrounding society. Man is the
               only animal who uses tools to alter his own inner world as well
               as the world around him. From the handkerchief knotted as a
               simple mnemonic device to the complexities of symbolic language,
               society provides the individual with technology that can be used
               to shape the private processes of mind. In Mind in Society
               Vygotsky applies this theoretical framework to the development of
               perception, attention, memory, language, and play, and he
               examines its implications for education. The result is a
               remarkably interesting book that is bound to renew Vygotsky’s
               relevance to modern psychological thought.},

  abstract  = {Interest in learning at work has captured the attention of many
               people around the world, often taking centre stage in policy
               debates about improving economic performance, prosperity and
               well-being. This book is about the learning that goes on in
               workplaces – ranging from offices, factories and shops to gyms,
               health centres and universities – and how it can be improved.
               Such learning includes everyday work activity, on-the-job
               instruction and off-the-job training events. Improving Working as
               Learning is the first book to analyze systematically learning at
               work in different settings by developing and applying a new
               analytical framework. The Working as Learning Framework connects
               the particularities of work tasks with the way jobs are organized
               and the wider pressures and constraints organizations face for
               survival, growth and development. The authors convincingly
               demonstrate that the framework offers a sophisticated
               understanding of how improving the work environment – both within
               the workplace and beyond – can enhance and sustain improvements
               in learning at work. This topical book will appeal to an
               international readership of undergraduate and postgraduate

                  context of a Chinese division of a multinational
                  pharmaceutical company, where pharmaceutical representatives
                  are tasked with relaying relevant efficacy and safety
                  information on pharmaceutical products to health care
                  professionals who prescribe them to patients. Methods: The
                  present study employed a three-group between-subjects
                  experimental design. Representatives received varying forms of
                  training (instruction only, instruction plus reflection, and
                  instruction, reflection, plus direct feedback) based on
                  experimental conditions. After three training sessions over
                  the course of six weeks, representatives were assessed on how
                  much they learned in the training and their actual work
                  performance through observer assessment of meetings with
                  health care professionals, facilitated by the representatives.
                  Findings: In this study, it was found that the process of
                  actively reflecting on what was learned in training led to
                  increased learning, as well as increased performance, compared
                  to simply studying the material. However, receiving direct
                  feedback on training performance, combined with active
                  reflection training, did not provide any further benefits in
                  terms of learning or work performance. Notably, there were no
                  differences in intent to transfer learned material to work, as
                  all conditions reported high levels of transfer intention.
                  Conclusion: The finding provides insightful evidence to
                  support the benefits of fostering trainees' active reflections
                  for work-based learning in the Chinese industry training
                  scenario. In contrast, receiving direct comments on how
                  students performed from a manager or trainer, as well as
                  advise on how do better in the future, had no effect on
                  increasing learning or performance. Although the effect of
                  direct feedback is not statistically significant in this
                  context, further research should be done in understanding
                  individuals' thoughts and behaviors when received direct
                  feedbacks received in workplace training. Relatively little
                  workplace research has assessed both workplace learning and
                  performance in the same study, specifically in the Chinese
                  context. While training efficacy likely varies across cultures
                  to begin with, compensation structures in China do not provide
                  the same monetary incentives for workplace learning (i.e.
                  chance to increase income) as Western culture. This means that
                  any way to increase workplace learning should be of extra
                  value, as employees otherwise may not engage in it at all.},

  abstract  = {Summary What is typical of a vocational curriculum is that it is
               a course of learning across different school- and work-based
               practices. This chapter discusses such learning in terms of
               boundary crossing between these practices. We conceptualize
               boundaries as sociocultural differences that lead to
               discontinuity in action or interaction. Such discontinuities
               between school and work practices have frequently been reported
               as problematic. Boundary crossing is defined as the efforts by
               individuals or groups to establish or restore continuity in
               relation to action or interaction across practices. As this
               chapter argues, these efforts point to the learning potential of
               boundary crossing between school and work practices, which we
               summarize in terms of four learning mechanisms: identification,
               coordination, perspective making and taking (or mutual
               reflection), and transformation. These learning mechanisms are
               discussed through illustrations from vocational education and
               training. The chapter concludes by speculating on what would be
               fruitful boundary analyses of situations where a vocational
               curriculum could be improved.},

  abstract     = {Purpose Industry 4.0 is assumed to yield extensive
                  industry-spanning opportunities. However, exploiting these
                  opportunities requires a targeted implementation of Industry
                  4.0. The purpose of this paper is to generate a deeper
                  understanding of relevant implementation action. Existing
                  recommendations are mostly general, highly aggregated and
                  difficult to grasp. Yet, specific and concrete actions that
                  need to be taken to accelerate the realization of Industry 4.0
                  are essential.Design/methodology/approach The article uses 13
                  semi-structured in-depth expert interviews as the source of
                  empirical data. The interviews were conducted with managers
                  from Industry 4.0-experienced German manufacturing companies.
                  All interviews are analyzed using qualitative content
                  analysis.Findings The study reveals relevant and targeted
                  aspects for Industry 4.0 implementation: the development of
                  Industry 4.0-specific know-how, securing financial resources,
                  integrating employees into the implementation process and
                  establishing an open-minded and flexible corporate culture.
                  Further aspects include comprehensive planning processes,
                  cooperation with external partners, proper handling of data
                  interfaces, interdisciplinary communication, an adaptable
                  organizational structure and data security.Research
                  limitations/implications The paper is limited to German
                  manufacturing enterprises and should be transferred to other
                  industries and countries.Practical implications The study
                  supports managers to effectively implement Industry 4.0 within
                  their organizations and consequently benefit from Industry 4.0
                  and derives recommendations for future
                  research.Originality/value The paper is among the first to
                  give specific and concrete examples for lessons learned from
                  Industry 4.0 implementation, directly obtained from industrial

               access to the cultural items that enrich our lives. Amid this
               bounty will also be wrenching change. Professions of all
               kinds—from lawyers to truck drivers—will be forever upended.
               Companies will be forced to transform or die. Recent economic
               indicators reflect this shift: fewer people are working, and
               wages are falling even as productivity and profits soar. Drawing
               on years of research and up-to-the-minute trends, Brynjolfsson
               and McAfee identify the best strategies for survival and offer a
               new path to prosperity. These include revamping education so that
               it prepares people for the next economy instead of the last one,
               designing new collaborations that pair brute processing power
               with human ingenuity, and embracing policies that make sense in a
               radically transformed landscape. A fundamentally optimistic book,
               The Second Machine Age will alter how we think about issues of
               technological, societal, and economic progress.},

                  experienced significant disruption. Rapid technological
                  change, outsourcing and off shoring have beset manufacturing
                  resulting in a general and steady decline in manufacturing
                  employment. Despite this turbulence, there remains a strong
                  nostalgia for manufacturing resulting in frequent public
                  policy discussion about how best to revitalise the industry. A
                  popular view is that a strong manufacturing industry relies
                  upon an equally strong vocational, education and training
                  (VET) system to provide requisite skill needs. Given the
                  dramatic pace of change in the manufacturing industry do such
                  arguments still hold true? This paper considers this question
                  through an examination of what the revitalisation of US
                  manufacturing means for employment and skills needs and the
                  extent to which US?s decentralised and largely eroded VET
                  system serves as a barrier to the industry?s revitalisation.
                  Drawing upon a mixed method approach that includes primary and
                  secondary data collected in three US cities, the paper argues
                  that the focus on needing to have a strong VET system
                  overlooks the emergence of flexible micro-skill ecosystems
                  that evolve to address local skill needs. These micro skill
                  eco-systems open the prospects for skills and training
                  innovations to meet changing workforce needs in a changing
                  industry.},

  abstract     = {Background Spatial skills are crucial for carpentry and are a
                  major learning objective in the initial vocational training of
                  carpenter apprentices. Carpenters specifically need to develop
                  the capability to switch between two-dimensional (2D) and
                  three-dimensional (3D) representations. Previous studies have
                  explored spatial skills, but never in the context of
                  vocational education and training (VET). This study sheds
                  light on the level and evolution of spatial skills in the
                  initial vocational training of carpenter apprentices in
                  Switzerland. Methods In this study, 726 subjects (98 females)
                  who were either carpenter apprentices, apprentices of another
                  profession, or high school students, took a test on spatial
                  skills with three parts: mental rotation, paper folding, and
                  orthographic projections. The first two parts are widely used
                  tests for spatial skills, while the last one was specifically
                  designed to address the 2D-3D transition that is a core skill
                  of carpenters. Results Carpenter apprentices do have higher
                  spatial skills than would be expected given their general
                  school level. In particular, their spatial skills were found
                  to be similar to those of high school students and superior to
                  those of apprentices of another profession. Carpenters’
                  spatial skills improve over the course of their
                  apprenticeship. These findings confirm that spatial skills are
                  trainable and suggest that the high spatial skills level of
                  carpenter apprentices is due to a selection bias as well as to
                  the training that they receive during their apprenticeship.
                  Conclusions Carpenter apprentices improve their spatial skills
                  over the time of their initial vocational training. As spatial
                  skills are crucial in this profession, there is a need to
                  develop further solutions that encourage further improvement
                  of teaching and learning activities for spatial skills.},

                  lens through which workplace learning more generally can be
                  examined. Drawing on data from a 3-year study of the social
                  and pedagogical relationships between apprentices and older
                  workers in the English steel industry, the article proposes
                  that, building on Engeström's work, an ‘expansive’ as opposed
                  to a ‘restrictive’ approach to apprenticeship will not only
                  deliver the broader goals being set for apprenticeship
                  programmes around the world, but will also foster workplace
                  learning. The article offers a critique of Lave and Wenger's
                  novice to expert conceptualisation of apprenticeship and,
                  using data from employee learning logs, argues that

                  training's identity has been founded on four types of
                  characteristics: epistemological, teleological, hierarchical
                  and pragmatic. No single characteristic is found to be
                  adequate to identify vocational education and training across
                  jurisdictions, and across historical periods. Both Rushbrook
                  and Stevenson seek for vocational education and training what
                  Rushbrook calls an ?abstracted institutional teleology?. Yet
                  such a quest may degenerate into essentialism, and in any case
                  is vulnerable to being made obsolete by the changes that
                  vocational education and training is meant to be stimulating
                  and to equip us for life. The article concludes by arguing for
                  a definition of vocational education and training which is a
                  compound of the four general characteristics considered.},

  abstract    = {Workforce training is needed throughout the construction
                 industry to create and maintain competent workers;
                 unfortunately, most construction training and education
                 research focuses on university student education. The focus of
                 this dissertation research is the current state of
                 educational-theory embedded construction workforce training,
                 how such trainings are effective, and how they may be further
                 optimized based on established educational theory. This is
                 accomplished through a review of construction training for
                 current industry professionals, an evaluation of the assessment
                 criteria used to measure effectiveness, followed by the
                 creation of a framework for construction training. There is a
                 lack of recommendations for improvement of construction
                 training across the industry. To establish the current state of
                 construction industry training, a review of education
                 theory-integrated training for construction professionals is
                 undertaken. To measure the extent of educational theory
                 integration, this dissertation summarizes studies that meet
                 inclusion criteria, identifies the frequency of occurrence of
                 Bloom’s Taxonomy verbs as a measure of student learning
                 outcomes, and identifies and compares commonly used words
                 within the identified construction training literature and
                 foundational educational theory literature. The results provide
                 a baseline of education theory-integrated construction training
                 research, from which gaps and best practices can be identified.
                 Existing construction training programs are not properly
                 measured for effectiveness. A review of the current
                 methodologies used in construction trainings published in
                 archival literature is conducted to evaluate the effectiveness
                 of training programs. These practices are compared against the
                 Kirkpatrick Model, an evaluation framework. The assessment
                 methodologies in the literature are synthesized with
                 corresponding levels found in the Kirkpatrick Model. Properly
                 integrating educational theory into construction workforce
                 training has the potential to improve industry training;
                 however, there is a dearth of studies that present details of
                 this integration process. To address this gap, a training
                 framework is created to educate material installers on material
                 properties, selection, and installation. This framework is
                 based on andragogical and Universal Design for Learning (UDL)
                 principles. An assessment tool provides a method of evaluating
                 similar training agendas to improve instructional design before
                 training implementation. The created framework culminates by
                 establishing linkages from educational theory to proposed
                 training modules.},

                  presents a framework for construction industry training
                  assessment that identifies established practices rooted in
                  evaluation science and developed from a review of archival
                  construction industry training literature. Inclusion criteria
                  for the evaluated studies are: archival training studies
                  focused on the construction industry workforce and integration
                  of educational theory in training creation or implementation.
                  Literature meeting these criteria are summarized and a case
                  review is presented detailing assessment practices and
                  results. The assessment practices are then synthesized with
                  the Kirkpatrick Model to analyze how closely industry

                  identified studies, established survey writing practices, and
                  the Kirkpatrick Model. This study found that two-thirds of

                  interviews to assess training efficacy, two studies that used
                  questionnaires to assess training efficacy provided question
                  text, three studies measured learning by administering tests
                  to training participants, one study measured changed behavior

                 project, and no contractor would be able to operate without the
                 skilled laborers that they employ. The construction industry
                 has been subject to a shortage of skilled labor for the last
                 two decades for many reasons, including the poor image of
                 construction workers among the public, inadequate training
                 measures, and an aging workforce. Reviewing the literature on
                 the matter shows that the leading cause of shortage is low pay
                 and increasing age of the workforce overall, while the demand
                 for labor grows at a faster rate than the supply of labor
                 grows. Poor worker retention practices were also identified as
                 a cause for shortage and a reason for workers leaving the
                 industry, and proper retention tactics are assessed, including
                 monetary and non-monetary considerations for workers in order
                 to foster a better employer-employee relationship. Recruiting
                 practices among labor unions and contractors are also assessed
                 through interviews and research, with the results suggesting
                 that a greater emphasis should be put on improving the image of
                 construction workers in the public eye, increasing the prestige
                 of a job in construction and leading to increased participation

                  With the visionary idea of Industry 4.0 that focuses on
                  digitization of the value chain of a product and improving
                  productivity through a variety of technologies and automated

                  company. Current state of the art of the technologies in

                4.0 framework for the construction sector. Industry 4.0 promises
                to revolutionize how ‘things’ are made by using physical and
                digital technologies in an integrated manner. Similarly, the
                authors envision that the Construction 4.0 framework can
                fundamentally change the way that assets are designed,
                constructed, and operated. The idea of the Construction 4.0
                developed from the need of the construction sector to overcome
                the existing horizontal, vertical, and longitudinal
                fragmentation and to take a holistic approach to the
                improvements needed in the industry. In this study, a literature
                review of Industry 4.0 and its influence on the construction
                sector was undertaken. Based on this systematic literature
                review, the authors define the Construction 4.0 framework and
                provide its benefits and barriers to implementation. A key
                finding of the study is that building information modeling, and
                a common data environment form the key foundation for the
                implementation of the Construction 4.0 framework. In defining
                the Construction 4.0 framework, the paper described its
                components and how its implementation is likely to proceed. The
                authors envision that by adopting Construction 4.0, the industry
                can transform itself into a highly efficient, quality-centered,
                and safe industry capable of successfully delivering the demands

                  benefits in terms of improvements in productivity and quality,
                  this concept has not gained much attention in the construction

                  far-reaching implications of the increasingly digitised and
                  automated manufacturing environment are still widely unknown.
                  Against this backdrop, the primary objective of this paper is

               course or research project. Eight steps: Foolproof for any
               beginner researcher, the book breaks the process of designing and
               doing a research project into achievable stages. It delivers
               students from research problem to their written research report
               at the pace they need, with clear explanations, DIY tasks and
               study skills support. In a new landscape format it presents
               figures, models and visualizations elegantly, so they don't break
               over a page, making even complex concepts easier to understand.
               Two pathways: With an innovative, beautiful design, regular
               progress checkpoints have been built into the book and its online
               resources. As students proceed through the 8 steps, each chapter
               provides regular opportunities for students to check
               understanding or give themselves a challenge. Each pathway then
               gives them the resources they need. Confused? Stop, practise with
               quizzes and flashcards, or use a video to look at a concept a
               different way. Up for a challenge? Access a wealth of additional
               material including research articles, readings, case studies,

  abstract  = {A trade union is an organized association of workers formed for
               the protection and promotion of their common interests. The
               standard view of unions is that they are monopoly organizations
               that improve the welfare of members, principally by raising wages
               above the competitive level. For a union to be able to increase
               wage rates above the competitive level, there must be some
               surplus that can be shared between the firm and the union, and
               the union must have some bargaining power to induce the firm to
               share this surplus. This article investigates the conditions
               under which a union can increase wages, and explores ways of
               modeling the competing preferences of unions and management. The
               article also notes the arguments suggesting that, in the presence
               of imperfect information and uncertainty, unions may enhance
               efficiency. To the extent that unions reduce labor turnover and
               negotiating costs, they may increase the available surplus to be
               shared between parties.},

               they have been organized spatially. Specifically, the section
               defines and contrasts different types of unionism – craft

               ponders some of the spatial implications of such different models

               quite different geographical structures and loci of power than do
               those which are more centralized, for instance. The second

               sector backed with unprecedented levels of funding from venture
               capital funds or other large investment firms. These entrants
               seek to leverage industry 4.0 principles for the digitalization
               and industrialization of construction. In addition to new
               technologies, these firms also bring new business models that
               depart from the project-based tendering system found in
               traditional construction. The first new business model is
               vertical integration. These firms are structured as integrated
               hierarchical firms, keeping control of product architecture and
               processes in-house. These firms control production by developing
               their own off-site factories. The second new business model is
               digital systems integration. These firms leverage an integrated
               cloud-based product configurator to enable mass customization.
               Using principles of capital-light industry 4.0 supply chains,
               digital system integrators can manufacture parts from periphery
               supply chain partners suppliers, including new sectors such as
               automotive, aerospace, manufacturing or industrial. The third new
               business model is the transformation of an existing project-based
               business toward industrialized construction through the creation
               of a spinoff factories. The chapter includes examples of the
               three business models and concludes with a discussion of how new
               business models may be catalysts for potential disruption of the

               papers has been to understand workplace learning and the ways in
               which it can be enhanced. By drawing on leading edge research
               from a number of countries and different disciplinary
               backgrounds, this book provides a synthesis of theory and
               empirical research. A key theme running through all the chapters
               is that learning that takes place in the workplace is highly
               contextualized. This requires a focus on the learner, the process
               of learning and a range of sources of learning other than
               structured and intentional interventions by teachers and
               trainers. Nevertheless, this focus on learning rather than
               teaching does not mean a focus on the learner as an individual.
               Individuals learn through their membership of social groups and
               the workplace is par excellence a site for participating in the
               social relations of production. The context of learning can be
               conceptualized at a number of different levels, requiring an
               understanding of societal, institutional and organizational
               structures, as well as the social relations of work groups and
               ‘communities of practice’ external to the workplace.},

                  current skills gap in both generic and skill areas within the
                  construction industry in Queensland, Australia.
                  Design/methodology/approach – An internet-based survey was
                  administered to collect the opinions of construction employees
                  about the workplace-training environment and their perceptions
                  towards training. The survey intended to address the following
                  research questions, specifically in relation to the
                  construction industry. Findings – The survey results reveal
                  that whilst overall participation in workplace training is
                  high, the current workplace training environments do not
                  foster balanced skill development. The study reveals that in
                  the current absence of a formal and well-balanced training
                  mechanism, construction workers generally resort to their own
                  informal self-development initiatives to develop the needed
                  role-specific theoretical knowledge. Research
                  limitations/implications – The findings of the research are
                  based on the data primarily collected in the construction
                  industry in Queensland, Australia. The data are limited to a
                  single Tier 2 construction company. Practical implications –
                  The findings of this study can be utilised to suggest
                  improvements in the current (or develop new) workplace
                  training initiatives. Social implications – The research
                  suggests that workplace training has positive relationship
                  with career growth. The results suggest that in the
                  construction industry, employees are generally well aware of
                  the importance of workplace training in their career
                  development and they largely appreciate training as being a
                  critical factor for developing their capacity to perform their
                  roles successfully, and to maintain their employability.
                  Originality/value – This paper is unique as it investigates
                  the current skills gap in both generic and skill areas within
                  the construction industry in Queensland, Australia. So far no
                  work has been undertaken to identify and discusses the main
                  method of workplace learning within the Tier 2 industry in the
                  context of Queensland Australia.},

                  in the British construction industry and their consequences
                  for learning. Under the traditional ?adversarial? system,
                  conflict, hostility and litigation between contractors are
                  commonplace. Such a climate actively militates against
                  collective learning and knowledge sharing between parties.
                  Conversely, under ?collaborative working?, contractors share
                  risks, pool knowledge and work together to solve problems at
                  all stages and levels in the productive system ? a process
                  conceptualised as ?knotworking? by some theorists. The paper
                  argues that such learning theories fail to take adequately
                  into account the heavy hand of history and the importance of
                  understanding the nature of the productive systems in which
                  ?knotworking? is expected to take root. Both place limits on
                  making ?knotworking? a habitual and commonplace activity in

                  automation and other types of technological changes on labor
                  demand, and use it to interpret changes in US employment over
                  the recent past. At the center of our framework is the
                  allocation of tasks to capital and labor—the task content of
                  production. Automation, which enables capital to replace labor
                  in tasks it was previously engaged in, shifts the task content
                  of production against labor because of a displacement effect.
                  As a result, automation always reduces the labor share in
                  value added and may reduce labor demand even as it raises
                  productivity. The effects of automation are counterbalanced by
                  the creation of new tasks in which labor has a comparative
                  advantage. The introduction of new tasks changes the task
                  content of production in favor of labor because of a
                  reinstatement effect, and always raises the labor share and
                  labor demand. We show how the role of changes in the task
                  content of production—due to automation and new tasks—can be
                  inferred from industry-level data. Our empirical decomposition
                  suggests that the slower growth of employment over the last
                  three decades is accounted for by an acceleration in the
                  displacement effect, especially in manufacturing, a weaker
                  reinstatement effect, and slower growth of productivity than
                  in previous decades.},

               examines the role of apprenticeship in training and upgrading for
               middle-level occupations. The first section defines and describes
               middle-skills occupations, largely in terms of education and

               alternative approaches to preparing and upgrading the skills of
               individuals for these occupations. Programs of academic education
               and apprenticeship programs emphasizing work-based learning have
               often competed for the same space but with significant
               complementarities. Third, we consider the evidence on the costs
               and effectiveness of apprenticeship training in several countries
               from the employer, worker, and government perspectives. The final

  abstract     = {What does “transforming” construction mean? – Where is it, who
                  is doing the transforming, and how (and when) do we know it is
                  happening? In Construction Management and Economics and
                  elsewhere, there is a longstanding discussion amongst scholars
                  on the topic of innovation in construction – but what of
                  transformation in construction? Is it different, and if so –
                  how? We set out with this Special Issue to answer these
                  questions and advance the theoretical understanding of the
                  transformation of the built environment, and how this requires
                  the construction industry to transform accordingly. We believe
                  that a “transforming construction” research agenda entails a
                  multi-scalar perspective and therefore called for papers on
                  industry-level transforming, firm-level transforming, and
                  project- and programme-level transforming. We also recognise
                  the process focus in contemporary social science through our
                  framing of “transforming” construction as never-ending, and by
                  seeking out accounts of how this is unfolding in practice.
                  This resulting Special Issue will hopefully act as a
                  provocation for new perspectives on transforming construction:
                  it attempts to revisit, re-evaluate, and re-invent how we
                  conceptualise both construction and construction research. The
                  eight papers build on a strong legacy of research on
                  innovation in construction management, while providing new
                  insights on what is being transformed and how; locating,
                  albeit tentatively, where the future debates are; and
                  identifying spaces where rich data may be found. Readers will
                  find a stimulating range of conceptual thinking and empirical
                  evidence being brought to bear on change, innovation, and
                  transformation, with extensive discussion of implications for
                  future research on construction policy, projects, and people,
                  broadening our field of view and drawing out strong new ideas
                  to guide practice. The structure of this Editorial is as
                  follows. First, we provide a synthetic recap of key themes
                  within the transforming construction topic, as outlined in the
                  Call for Papers. Secondly, we summarise the content of the
                  eight accepted papers, positioning each paper under one of
                  three headings, which reflect the multi-scale perspective of
                  the Special Issue and as presented previously in the Call for
                  Papers. We then go on to a discussion section, in which we set
                  out what we see as five major themes emerging from the papers,
                  characterising what transforming construction looks like from
                  the perspective of these authors. There is a conclusion
                  section to identify what the editorial team feels are the most
                  pertinent reflections and questions, in a bid to offer some
                  direction to future research in the area, followed by a short
                  commentary on some limitations of the Special Issue.},
