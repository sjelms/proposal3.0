                 is a course of learning across different school- and work-based
                 practices. This chapter discusses such learning in terms of
                 boundary crossing between these practices. We conceptualize
                 boundaries as sociocultural differences that lead to
                 discontinuity in action or interaction. Such discontinuities
                 between school and work practices have frequently been reported
                 as problematic. Boundary crossing is defined as the efforts by
                 individuals or groups to establish or restore continuity in
                 relation to action or interaction across practices. As this
                 chapter argues, these efforts point to the learning potential
                 of boundary crossing between school and work practices, which
                 we summarize in terms of four learning mechanisms:
                 identification, coordination, perspective making and taking (or
                 mutual reflection), and transformation. These learning
                 mechanisms are discussed through illustrations from vocational
                 education and training. The chapter concludes by speculating on
                 what would be fruitful boundary analyses of situations where a
                 vocational curriculum could be improved.",

               seek to leverage industry 4.0 principles for the digitalization

               depart from the project-based tendering system found in
               traditional construction. The first new business model is
               vertical integration. These firms are structured as integrated
               hierarchical firms, keeping control of product architecture and
               processes in-house. These firms control production by developing
               their own off-site factories. The second new business model is
               digital systems integration. These firms leverage an integrated
               cloud-based product configurator to enable mass customization.
               Using principles of capital-light industry 4.0 supply chains,
               digital system integrators can manufacture parts from periphery

               the protection and promotion of their common interests. The
               standard view of unions is that they are monopoly organizations
               that improve the welfare of members, principally by raising wages
               above the competitive level. For a union to be able to increase
               wage rates above the competitive level, there must be some
               surplus that can be shared between the firm and the union, and
               the union must have some bargaining power to induce the firm to
               share this surplus. This article investigates the conditions
               under which a union can increase wages, and explores ways of
               modeling the competing preferences of unions and management. The

               of imperfect information and uncertainty, unions may enhance
               efficiency. To the extent that unions reduce labor turnover and
               negotiating costs, they may increase the available surplus to be

              has not gained much attention in the construction industry. This
              development is founded in the fact that the far-reaching
              implications of the increasingly digitised and automated
              manufacturing environment are still widely unknown. Against this
              backdrop, the primary objective of this paper is to explore the
              state of the art as well as the state of practice of Industry 4.0
              relating technologies in the construction industry by pointing out
              the political, economic, social, technological, environmental and
              legal implications of its adoption. In this context, we present
              the results of our triangulation approach, which consists of a
              comprehensive systematic literature review and case study
              research, by illustrating a PESTEL framework and a value chain
              model. Additionally, we provide recommendations for further
              research within a research agenda.",

  abstract  = "AbstractManufacturing in advanced open economies has experienced
               significant disruption. Rapid technological change, outsourcing
               and off shoring have beset manufacturing resulting in a general
               and steady decline in manufacturing employment. Despite this
               turbulence, there remains a strong nostalgia for manufacturing
               resulting in frequent public policy discussion about how best to
               revitalise the industry. A popular view is that a strong
               manufacturing industry relies upon an equally strong vocational,
               education and training (VET) system to provide requisite skill
               needs. Given the dramatic pace of change in the manufacturing
               industry do such arguments still hold true? This paper considers
               this question through an examination of what the revitalisation
               of US manufacturing means for employment and skills needs and the
               extent to which US?s decentralised and largely eroded VET system
               serves as a barrier to the industry?s revitalisation. Drawing
               upon a mixed method approach that includes primary and secondary
               data collected in three US cities, the paper argues that the
               focus on needing to have a strong VET system overlooks the
               emergence of flexible micro-skill ecosystems that evolve to
               address local skill needs. These micro skill eco-systems open the
               prospects for skills and training innovations to meet changing

               pragmatic. No single characteristic is found to be adequate to
               identify vocational education and training across jurisdictions,
               and across historical periods. Both Rushbrook and Stevenson seek
               for vocational education and training what Rushbrook calls an
               ?abstracted institutional teleology?. Yet such a quest may
               degenerate into essentialism, and in any case is vulnerable to
               being made obsolete by the changes that vocational education and
               training is meant to be stimulating and to equip us for life. The
               article concludes by arguing for a definition of vocational
               education and training which is a compound of the four general

               hostility and litigation between contractors are commonplace.
               Such a climate actively militates against collective learning and
               knowledge sharing between parties. Conversely, under
               ?collaborative working?, contractors share risks, pool knowledge
               and work together to solve problems at all stages and levels in
               the productive system ? a process conceptualised as ?knotworking?

               fail to take adequately into account the heavy hand of history

               systems in which ?knotworking? is expected to take root. Both

               involvement, organisational performance, and the broader
               economic, regulatory, and social context within which
               organisations have to operate. This article argues that we have
               to identify and take serious account of the contextual factors
               (external and internal) that affect all organisations, as these
               are central to developing our understanding of the nature of
               pedagogical practice within any workplace setting. By closely
               examining the nature and impact of these contextual factors, we
               can gain greater insight into the phenomenon of why organisations
               adopt different practices and why they create such different
               learning environments. The article draws on emerging findings
               from an ESRC?funded multisector study in the UK and uses

               The purpose of this paper is to generate a deeper understanding
               of relevant implementation action. Existing recommendations are
               mostly general, highly aggregated and difficult to grasp. Yet,

               semi-structured in-depth expert interviews as the source of
               empirical data. The interviews were conducted with managers from
               Industry 4.0-experienced German manufacturing companies. All

               construction industry in Queensland, Australia.
               Design/methodology/approach – An internet-based survey was
               administered to collect the opinions of construction employees
               about the workplace-training environment and their perceptions
               towards training. The survey intended to address the following
               research questions, specifically in relation to the construction
               industry. Findings – The survey results reveal that whilst
               overall participation in workplace training is high, the current
               workplace training environments do not foster balanced skill
               development. The study reveals that in the current absence of a
               formal and well-balanced training mechanism, construction workers
               generally resort to their own informal self-development
               initiatives to develop the needed role-specific theoretical
               knowledge. Research limitations/implications – The findings of
               the research are based on the data primarily collected in the
               construction industry in Queensland, Australia. The data are
               limited to a single Tier 2 construction company. Practical
               implications – The findings of this study can be utilised to
               suggest improvements in the current (or develop new) workplace
               training initiatives. Social implications – The research suggests
               that workplace training has positive relationship with career
               growth. The results suggest that in the construction industry,
               employees are generally well aware of the importance of workplace
               training in their career development and they largely appreciate
               training as being a critical factor for developing their capacity
               to perform their roles successfully, and to maintain their
               employability. Originality/value – This paper is unique as it
               investigates the current skills gap in both generic and skill
               areas within the construction industry in Queensland, Australia.

  abstract  = "Background Spatial skills are crucial for carpentry and are a
               major learning objective in the initial vocational training of
               carpenter apprentices. Carpenters specifically need to develop
               the capability to switch between two-dimensional (2D) and
               three-dimensional (3D) representations. Previous studies have
               explored spatial skills, but never in the context of vocational
               education and training (VET). This study sheds light on the level
               and evolution of spatial skills in the initial vocational
               training of carpenter apprentices in Switzerland. Methods In this
               study, 726 subjects (98 females) who were either carpenter
               apprentices, apprentices of another profession, or high school
               students, took a test on spatial skills with three parts: mental
               rotation, paper folding, and orthographic projections. The first
               two parts are widely used tests for spatial skills, while the
               last one was specifically designed to address the 2D-3D
               transition that is a core skill of carpenters. Results Carpenter
               apprentices do have higher spatial skills than would be expected
               given their general school level. In particular, their spatial
               skills were found to be similar to those of high school students
               and superior to those of apprentices of another profession.
               Carpenters’ spatial skills improve over the course of their
               apprenticeship. These findings confirm that spatial skills are
               trainable and suggest that the high spatial skills level of
               carpenter apprentices is due to a selection bias as well as to
               the training that they receive during their apprenticeship.
               Conclusions Carpenter apprentices improve their spatial skills
               over the time of their initial vocational training. As spatial
               skills are crucial in this profession, there is a need to develop
               further solutions that encourage further improvement of teaching
               and learning activities for spatial skills.",

              and other types of technological changes on labor demand, and use
              it to interpret changes in US employment over the recent past. At
              the center of our framework is the allocation of tasks to capital
              and labor—the task content of production. Automation, which
              enables capital to replace labor in tasks it was previously
              engaged in, shifts the task content of production against labor
              because of a displacement effect. As a result, automation always
              reduces the labor share in value added and may reduce labor demand
              even as it raises productivity. The effects of automation are
              counterbalanced by the creation of new tasks in which labor has a
              comparative advantage. The introduction of new tasks changes the
              task content of production in favor of labor because of a

              especially in manufacturing, a weaker reinstatement effect, and

               capital, knowledge-creating organizations, knowledge work, and
               the like rests on a single, traditional understanding of the
               nature of knowledge. We call this understanding the ?epistemology
               of possession,? since it treats knowledge as something people
               possess. Yet, this epistemology cannot account for the knowing
               found in individual and group practice. Knowing as action calls
               for an ?epistemology of practice.? Moreover, the epistemology of
               possession tends to privilege explicit over tacit knowledge, and
               knowledge possessed by individuals over that possessed by groups.
               Current work on organizations is limited by this privileging and
               by the scant attention given to knowing in its own right.
               Organizations are better understood if explicit, tacit,
               individual and group knowledge are treated as four distinct and
               coequal forms of knowledge (each doing work the others cannot),
               and if knowledge and knowing are seen as mutually enabling (not
               competing). We hold that knowledge is a tool of knowing, that
               knowing is an aspect of our interaction with the social and
               physical world, and that the interplay of knowledge and knowing
               can generate new knowledge and new ways of knowing. We believe
               this generative dance between knowledge and knowing is a powerful
               source of organizational innovation. Harnessing this innovation
               calls for organizational and technological infrastructures that
               support the interplay of knowledge and knowing. Ultimately, these
               concepts make possible a more robust framing of such
               epistemologically-centered concerns as core competencies, the
               management of intellectual capital, etc. We explore these views
               through three brief case studies drawn from recent research.",

               different training modalities on increasing workplace learning,
               representatives' intent to transfer what they learned into their
               work, and importantly how training impacts actual work
               performance. These relationships are tested in the context of a
               Chinese division of a multinational pharmaceutical company, where
               pharmaceutical representatives are tasked with relaying relevant
               efficacy and safety information on pharmaceutical products to
               health care professionals who prescribe them to patients.
               Methods: The present study employed a three-group
               between-subjects experimental design. Representatives received
               varying forms of training (instruction only, instruction plus
               reflection, and instruction, reflection, plus direct feedback)
               based on experimental conditions. After three training sessions
               over the course of six weeks, representatives were assessed on
               how much they learned in the training and their actual work
               performance through observer assessment of meetings with health
               care professionals, facilitated by the representatives. Findings:
               In this study, it was found that the process of actively
               reflecting on what was learned in training led to increased
               learning, as well as increased performance, compared to simply
               studying the material. However, receiving direct feedback on
               training performance, combined with active reflection training,
               did not provide any further benefits in terms of learning or work
               performance. Notably, there were no differences in intent to
               transfer learned material to work, as all conditions reported
               high levels of transfer intention. Conclusion: The finding
               provides insightful evidence to support the benefits of fostering
               trainees' active reflections for work-based learning in the
               Chinese industry training scenario. In contrast, receiving direct
               comments on how students performed from a manager or trainer, as
               well as advise on how do better in the future, had no effect on
               increasing learning or performance. Although the effect of direct
               feedback is not statistically significant in this context,
               further research should be done in understanding individuals'
               thoughts and behaviors when received direct feedbacks received in
               workplace training. Relatively little workplace research has
               assessed both workplace learning and performance in the same
               study, specifically in the Chinese context. While training
               efficacy likely varies across cultures to begin with,
               compensation structures in China do not provide the same monetary
               incentives for workplace learning (i.e. chance to increase
               income) as Western culture. This means that any way to increase
               workplace learning should be of extra value, as employees
               otherwise may not engage in it at all.",

               Drawing on data from a 3-year study of the social and pedagogical
               relationships between apprentices and older workers in the
               English steel industry, the article proposes that, building on

               understand economic and political polarization in the age of
               automation From the Industrial Revolution to the age of
               artificial intelligence, The Technology Trap takes a sweeping
               look at the history of technological progress and how it has
               radically shifted the distribution of economic and political
               power among society's members. As Carl Benedikt Frey shows, the
               Industrial Revolution created unprecedented wealth and prosperity
               over the long run, but the immediate consequences of
               mechanization were devastating for large swaths of the
               population. Middle-income jobs withered, wages stagnated, the
               labor share of income fell, profits surged, and economic
               inequality skyrocketed. These trends, Frey documents, broadly
               mirror those in our current age of automation, which began with
               the Computer Revolution. Just as the Industrial Revolution
               eventually brought about extraordinary benefits for society,
               artificial intelligence systems have the potential to do the
               same. But Frey argues that this depends on how the short term is
               managed. In the nineteenth century, workers violently expressed
               their concerns over machines taking their jobs. The Luddite
               uprisings joined a long wave of machinery riots that swept across
               Europe and China. Today's despairing middle class has not
               resorted to physical force, but their frustration has led to
               rising populism and the increasing fragmentation of society. As
               middle-class jobs continue to come under pressure, there's no
               assurance that positive attitudes to technology will persist. The
               Industrial Revolution was a defining moment in history, but few
               grasped its enormous consequences at the time. The Technology
               Trap demonstrates that in the midst of another technological
               revolution, the lessons of the past can help us to more
               effectively face the present.",

               recognized as a pioneer in developmental psychology. But somewhat
               ironically, his theory of development has never been well
               understood in the West. Mind in Society should correct much of
               this misunderstanding. Carefully edited by a group of outstanding
               Vygotsky scholars, the book presents a unique selection of
               Vygotsky’s important essays, most of which have previously been
               unavailable in English.The Vygotsky who emerges from these pages
               can no longer be glibly included among the neobehaviorists. In
               these essays he outlines a dialectical-materialist theory of
               cognitive development that anticipates much recent work in
               American social science. The mind, Vygotsky argues, cannot be
               understood in isolation from the surrounding society. Man is the
               only animal who uses tools to alter his own inner world as well
               as the world around him. From the handkerchief knotted as a
               simple mnemonic device to the complexities of symbolic language,
               society provides the individual with technology that can be used
               to shape the private processes of mind. In Mind in Society
               Vygotsky applies this theoretical framework to the development of
               perception, attention, memory, language, and play, and he
               examines its implications for education. The result is a
               remarkably interesting book that is bound to renew Vygotsky’s
               relevance to modern psychological thought.",

               4.0 framework for the construction sector. Industry 4.0 promises
               to revolutionize how ‘things’ are made by using physical and
               digital technologies in an integrated manner. Similarly, the
               authors envision that the Construction 4.0 framework can
               fundamentally change the way that assets are designed,
               constructed, and operated. The idea of the Construction 4.0
               developed from the need of the construction sector to overcome
               the existing horizontal, vertical, and longitudinal fragmentation
               and to take a holistic approach to the improvements needed in the
               industry. In this study, a literature review of Industry 4.0 and
               its influence on the construction sector was undertaken. Based on
               this systematic literature review, the authors define the
               Construction 4.0 framework and provide its benefits and barriers
               to implementation. A key finding of the study is that building

               foundation for the implementation of the Construction 4.0
               framework. In defining the Construction 4.0 framework, the paper
               described its components and how its implementation is likely to
               proceed. The authors envision that by adopting Construction 4.0,

  abstract = "Workforce training is needed throughout the construction industry
              to create and maintain competent workers; unfortunately, most
              construction training and education research focuses on university
              student education. The focus of this dissertation research is the
              current state of educational-theory embedded construction
              workforce training, how such trainings are effective, and how they
              may be further optimized based on established educational theory.
              This is accomplished through a review of construction training for
              current industry professionals, an evaluation of the assessment
              criteria used to measure effectiveness, followed by the creation
              of a framework for construction training. There is a lack of
              recommendations for improvement of construction training across
              the industry. To establish the current state of construction
              industry training, a review of education theory-integrated
              training for construction professionals is undertaken. To measure
              the extent of educational theory integration, this dissertation
              summarizes studies that meet inclusion criteria, identifies the
              frequency of occurrence of Bloom’s Taxonomy verbs as a measure of
              student learning outcomes, and identifies and compares commonly
              used words within the identified construction training literature
              and foundational educational theory literature. The results
              provide a baseline of education theory-integrated construction
              training research, from which gaps and best practices can be
              identified. Existing construction training programs are not
              properly measured for effectiveness. A review of the current
              methodologies used in construction trainings published in archival
              literature is conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of training
              programs. These practices are compared against the Kirkpatrick
              Model, an evaluation framework. The assessment methodologies in
              the literature are synthesized with corresponding levels found in
              the Kirkpatrick Model. Properly integrating educational theory
              into construction workforce training has the potential to improve
              industry training; however, there is a dearth of studies that
              present details of this integration process. To address this gap,
              a training framework is created to educate material installers on
              material properties, selection, and installation. This framework
              is based on andragogical and Universal Design for Learning (UDL)
              principles. An assessment tool provides a method of evaluating
              similar training agendas to improve instructional design before
              training implementation. The created framework culminates by
              establishing linkages from educational theory to proposed training
              modules.",

               assessment methods to consistently gauge the efficacy of
               workforce training programs. To address this issue, this study
               presents a framework for construction industry training
               assessment that identifies established practices rooted in
               evaluation science and developed from a review of archival
               construction industry training literature. Inclusion criteria for
               the evaluated studies are: archival training studies focused on
               the construction industry workforce and integration of
               educational theory in training creation or implementation.
               Literature meeting these criteria are summarized and a case
               review is presented detailing assessment practices and results.
               The assessment practices are then synthesized with the
               Kirkpatrick Model to analyze how closely industry assessment
               corresponds with established training evaluation standards. The
               study culminates in a training assessment framework created by
               integrating practices described in the identified studies,
               established survey writing practices, and the Kirkpatrick Model.
               This study found that two-thirds of reviewed literature used
               surveys, questionnaires, or interviews to assess training
               efficacy, two studies that used questionnaires to assess training
               efficacy provided question text, three studies measured learning
               by administering tests to training participants, one study
               measured changed behavior as a result of training, and one study
               measured organizational impact as a result of training.",

  abstract  = "As policy makers increasingly focus on workplace learning as a
               way of improving organizational performance, the debate about the
               learning organization has grown. Counterbalancing the often
               over-optimistic assumptions made about the future of work and
               learning, this book argues that without a contextualized analysis
               of the field, our understanding of the learning environment is
               limited. It reconsiders the true role and nature of workplace
               learning in context. Grounded in original research, the book
               features case studies which illuminate how the workplace
               environment can provide both barriers to and opportunities for
               learning. It explores learning in different organizational
               contexts and different countries, sectors, types of public and
               private sector organization, and by different occupational
               groups. This multi-disciplinary approach provides a coherent
               perspective of the institutional, organizational and pedagogical
               contexts of workplace learning, and as a result, policy-makers,
               trainers, trade unionists and educators alike will welcome this
               groundbreaking text, as it gives the intellectual tools required
               to understand how learning in the workplace can be improved.",

               learning that are often dichotomized: formal and informal, theory
               and practice. Indeed one of the central challenges facing all
               those involved in developing understandings of workplace learning
               is that of conceptualizing how these aspects of learning actually
               come together within the experience of the learners. This chapter
               outlines key aspects of our research into the accountancy
               profession which aims, amongst other things, to assist in the
               re-engineering of the learning experience within accountancy,

               power and perspective, within an understanding of the
               ‘disciplinary ways of being’ at the heart of modern learning, is
               fundamental to understandings of learning and also to the process

               from a number of countries and different disciplinary
               backgrounds, this book provides a synthesis of theory and
               empirical research. A key theme running through all the chapters
               is that learning that takes place in the workplace is highly
               contextualized. This requires a focus on the learner, the process
               of learning and a range of sources of learning other than
               structured and intentional interventions by teachers and
               trainers. Nevertheless, this focus on learning rather than
               teaching does not mean a focus on the learner as an individual.
               Individuals learn through their membership of social groups and
               the workplace is par excellence a site for participating in the
               social relations of production. The context of learning can be
               conceptualized at a number of different levels, requiring an
               understanding of societal, institutional and organizational
               structures, as well as the social relations of work groups and

  abstract  = "[John Dewey and L. S. Vygotsky share similar ideas concerning the
               relationship of activity and learning/development, especially the
               roles everyday activities and social environment play in the
               educational process. However, the two theorists are far apart in
               their conception of the relationship between process and goals in
               education. Dewey concentrates on means in education, believing
               that it is the ability of the individual to question through
               experience that is most important for the human community.
               Vygotsky, while recognizing the importance of (especially
               cultural) process in education, sees social and cultural goals as
               being integrated into social pedagogy. This paper compares Dewey
               and Vygotsky on three key points that relate directly to
               educational processes and goals. First, the two theorists are
               compared on the role of social history and the tools it produces.
               Dewey sees social history as creating a set of malleable tools
               that are of use in present circumstances. Vygotsky believes that
               tools developed through history have a far more lasting impact on
               the social community. Second, the two theorists are compared in
               their conceptualizations of experience/culture. Dewey sees
               experience as helping to form thinking, whereas Vygotsky, in his
               cultural historical theory, posits culture as the raw material of
               thinking. Third, the two theorists are compared on their
               perspectives on human inquiry. Dewey sees the child as a free
               agent who achieves goals through her own interest in the
               activity. Vygotsky suggests there should be greater control by a
               mentor who creates activity that will lead the child towards
               mastery. These differences are then explored in terms of how they
               might impact actual classroom strategies and curriculum.]",

  abstract = "Skilled labor is vital to the success of any construction project,
              and no contractor would be able to operate without the skilled
              laborers that they employ. The construction industry has been
              subject to a shortage of skilled labor for the last two decades
              for many reasons, including the poor image of construction workers
              among the public, inadequate training measures, and an aging
              workforce. Reviewing the literature on the matter shows that the
              leading cause of shortage is low pay and increasing age of the
              workforce overall, while the demand for labor grows at a faster
              rate than the supply of labor grows. Poor worker retention
              practices were also identified as a cause for shortage and a
              reason for workers leaving the industry, and proper retention
              tactics are assessed, including monetary and non-monetary
              considerations for workers in order to foster a better
              employer-employee relationship. Recruiting practices among labor
              unions and contractors are also assessed through interviews and

               whether old or new, raises basic questions about how skill is
               analysed and changes the nature of work and the balance of
               workplace power. The authors examine how the social construction
               of skills has changed in recent years with shifts in the balance
               of power between capital and labour and how the new social
               construction of skills affects different types of workers by sex,
               class, and race, variously helping and hindering the employment

                 research findings - both quantitative and qualitative - and
                 identifies ten key messages: (1) The starting points are to
                 recognise that: (a) paradigms of learning differ; and (b)
                 workplaces are contested spaces in which what counts as
                 'learning'; (2) Measures of 'learning as acquisition' include
                 the incidence of workplace training; (3) Real levels of
                 training expenditure by employers have also moved downwards;
                 (4) Despite the emphasis placed on training course attendance
                 and the acquisition of qualifications, both are relatively
                 low-rated by employees in terms of their helpfulness in
                 improving work performance; (5) At a time when formal workplace
                 training has been declining, the evidence suggests that the
                 importance of learning on-the-job is rising; (6) All sources of
                 workplace learning from whatever paradigm are skewed towards
                 those at the top of the occupational hierarchy; (7) Much of the
                 qualitative evidence shows that learning occurs naturally in
                 all workplaces as part of everyday activity in line with the
                 learning as participation approach; (8) Workplace learning
                 takes many forms stretching across a 'formal-informal'
                 continuum; (9) International research evidence suggests that
                 the key inter-related determinants in the variability of
                 workplace learning environments are context and individual
                 behaviour; and (10) External recognition and accreditation of
                 workplace learning is problematic due to its largely collective
                 and dynamic nature.",

               American highways and IBM’s Watson trounced the best human
               Jeopardy! players. Digital technologies—with hardware, software,
               and networks at their core—will in the near future diagnose
               diseases more accurately than doctors can, apply enormous data
               sets to transform retailing, and accomplish many tasks once
               considered uniquely human. In The Second Machine Age MIT’s Erik
               Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee—two thinkers at the forefront of
               their field—reveal the forces driving the reinvention of our
               lives and our economy. As the full impact of digital technologies
               is felt, we will realize immense bounty in the form of dazzling
               personal technology, advanced infrastructure, and near-boundless
               access to the cultural items that enrich our lives. Amid this
               bounty will also be wrenching change. Professions of all
               kinds—from lawyers to truck drivers—will be forever upended.
               Companies will be forced to transform or die. Recent economic
               indicators reflect this shift: fewer people are working, and
               wages are falling even as productivity and profits soar. Drawing
               on years of research and up-to-the-minute trends, Brynjolfsson
               and McAfee identify the best strategies for survival and offer a
               new path to prosperity. These include revamping education so that
               it prepares people for the next economy instead of the last one,
               designing new collaborations that pair brute processing power
               with human ingenuity, and embracing policies that make sense in a
               radically transformed landscape. A fundamentally optimistic book,

  abstract  = "Designed with students, for students Eight steps, two pathways,
               one book. The Fifth Edition of the bestseller Research
               Methodology has reimagined, redesigned, and fully renovated how a
               textbook can help students achieve success in their methods
               course or research project. Eight steps: Foolproof for any
               beginner researcher, the book breaks the process of designing and
               doing a research project into achievable stages. It delivers
               students from research problem to their written research report
               at the pace they need, with clear explanations, DIY tasks and
               study skills support. In a new landscape format it presents
               figures, models and visualizations elegantly, so they don't break
               over a page, making even complex concepts easier to understand.
               Two pathways: With an innovative, beautiful design, regular
               progress checkpoints have been built into the book and its online
               resources. As students proceed through the 8 steps, each chapter
               provides regular opportunities for students to check
               understanding or give themselves a challenge. Each pathway then
               gives them the resources they need. Confused? Stop, practise with
               quizzes and flashcards, or use a video to look at a concept a
               different way. Up for a challenge? Access a wealth of additional
               material including research articles, readings, case studies,
               activities, bibliography tools and inspiration to pursue your
               curiosity, impress your lecturer, and nail your assignments. With
               this one book, every student gets what they need to succeed. It
               is the perfect essential text for students and beginner
               researchers across the social sciences.",

  abstract  = "Interest in learning at work has captured the attention of many
               people around the world, often taking centre stage in policy
               debates about improving economic performance, prosperity and
               well-being. This book is about the learning that goes on in
               workplaces – ranging from offices, factories and shops to gyms,
               health centres and universities – and how it can be improved.
               Such learning includes everyday work activity, on-the-job
               instruction and off-the-job training events. Improving Working as
               Learning is the first book to analyze systematically learning at
               work in different settings by developing and applying a new
               analytical framework. The Working as Learning Framework connects
               the particularities of work tasks with the way jobs are organized
               and the wider pressures and constraints organizations face for
               survival, growth and development. The authors convincingly
               demonstrate that the framework offers a sophisticated
               understanding of how improving the work environment – both within
               the workplace and beyond – can enhance and sustain improvements
               in learning at work. This topical book will appeal to an
               international readership of undergraduate and postgraduate
               students, vocational teachers and trainers, human resource
               professionals, policy-makers, and researchers.",

  abstract  = "This book discusses what constitutes vocational education as well
               as its key purposes, objects, formation and practices. In short,
               it seeks to outline and elaborate the nature of the project of
               vocational education. It addresses a significant gap in the
               available literature by providing a single text that elaborates
               the scope and diversity of the sector, its key objectives (i.e.
               vocations and occupations), its formation and development as an
               education sector, and the scope of its purposes and
               considerations in the curriculum. The volume achieves these
               objectives by discussing and defining the concept of vocational
               education as being that form of education that seeks to advise
               individuals about, prepare them for, and further develop their
               capacities to perform the kinds of occupations that societies
               require and individuals need to participate in—and through which
               they often come to define themselves. In particular, it discusses
               the distinctions between occupations as a largely social fact and
               vocations as being a socially shaped outcome assented to by
               individuals. As people identify closely with the kinds of
               occupations they engage in, the standing of, and the
               effectiveness of vocational education is central to individuals’
               well-being, competence and progress. Ultimately, this book argues
               that the provision of vocational education needs to realise

               rapidly changing work activities. Work-related training of adults
               faces the challenge of raising the quality of learning. This book
               offers a framework for eliciting and supporting poductive
               learning through instruction. Training for change presents a
               cognitive and activity-theoretical view of learning and teaching.
               The book gives concrete guidelines and practical examples for the
               formulation of cognitive objectives of instruction, for the
               organization of learning contents, for the selection of
               instructional methods, and for the planning of curricula. It is
               useful for everyone interested in turning workplaces into
               learning organizations. Yrjö Engeström is Professor of

  abstract    = "Modular construction has often been criticized for limiting
                 architects' creativity in design. However, new approaches are
                 changing this perception by emphasizing early collaboration
                 with fabricators to enable unique designs that meet clients'
                 diverse needs. Modular construction has several advantages,
                 including quality and safety, schedule efficiency, and
                 sustainability, making it an attractive option for owners and
                 project teams. The American Institute of Architects (AIA)
                 Modular and Off-Site Construction Guide serves as a primer for
                 architects to explore the value and opportunities of modular
                 design, potential pitfalls to avoid, and relevant case studies
                 that illustrate successes and obstacles.",
